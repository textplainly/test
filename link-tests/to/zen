# link tests target with deep link match for `zen#koans.md`

This file exists as a test for the question posed in [`start.md`](../from/start.md):

> Should the `#koans.md` at the end of `zen#koans.md` be treated
> as a link to the heading `koans.md` in a file named `zen`, or as a
> link to a file named `zen#koans.md`?


## koans.md

Heading that `zen#koans.md` *could* link to.
