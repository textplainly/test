# link tests target with deep link match for `what#ever.md`

This file exists as a test for the question posed in [`start.md`](../from/start.md):

> Should the `#ever.md` at the end of `what#ever.md` be treated as a link
> to the heading `ever.md` in a file named `what`, or as a link to a file
> named `what#ever.md`?
